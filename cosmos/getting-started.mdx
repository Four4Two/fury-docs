This document will help you get a Blackfury Network up and running locally on your machine. It uses a CLI tool call `futool` that manages the configuration and initial setup of a network. The tool uses docker containers to run a Blackfury Network with some optional configuration.

You must have the following tools:

1. [Go 1.20.2](https://golang.org/doc/install) - used to build & install `futool`
2. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) - used by `futool` to run local networks.

## Ensure Go is setup in your PATH

Once Go & Docker are installed, update your bash_profile to include the go path.

```
export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH
export PATH=$HOME/go/bin:$PATH
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export GO111MODULE=on
```

Make sure to source your bash profile or restart it for the changes to take place.

## Getting The Blackfury Repository & Development Tools

Once you have the core tools installed & set up, its now time to get the following repositories from Github:

- [fury](https://github.com/Four4Two/fury) - Main Blackfury Repo that holds all modules
- [futool](https://github.com/Four4Two/futool) - Dev tools to interact with a Blackfury node

## Set Up a Local Blockchain

Now that you have set up all the tools & repositories in your local machine its finally time to set up a local blockchain.

- Open a terminal and change into the `futool` directory.
- Ensure Docker is running.
- Run `make install` in your terminal which will install `futool` in your machine.
- Run `futool testnet bootstrap`. By default, this command will initialize a docker container running the code of the current master branch of `fury`.

The `fury` is now running on your local machine! The endpoints are publically exposed to your localhost:

- RPC: http://localhost:26657
- REST: http://localhost:1317
- GRPC: http://localhost:9090
- GRPC Websocket: http://localhost:9091
- EVM JSON-RPC: http://localhost:8545
- EVM Websocket: http://localhost:8546

To interact with the network you can use `fury` CLI from your local machine by setting the `--node` flag:

```
fury --node http://localhost:26657 status
```

However, it is likely more convenient to run the `fury` CLI directly in the container. This ensures you are running a compatible version of the CLI and gives you access to the accounts configured in the local chain. To do this, add the following alias:

```bash
alias dfury='docker exec -it generated_furynode_1 fury'
```

Note that for some architectures or docker versions, the containers are generated with hyphens (`-`) instead of underscores (`_`).

This alias execs into the container and runs `fury`. From there you have access to accounts.

**Example**:
Create a new account & fund it:

```
$ fury keys add my-test-account

- name: my-test-account
  type: local
  address: fury17fuj33p6y472j3kplsjdz966xlw6cdhwqzl8rl
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"AnaP5cFfUDcK4jOGTLPCUPGqtijViYmCAd7XRg7XTQib"}'
  mnemonic: ""


**Important** write this mnemonic phrase in a safe place.
It is the only way to recover your account if you ever forget your password.

$ fury tx bank send whale fury17fuj33p6y472j3kplsjdz966xlw6cdhwqzl8rl 1000000000ufury --gas-prices 0.01ufury -y
```

The above creates a new randomly generated account (`fury17fuj33p6y472j3kplsjdz966xlw6cdhwqzl8rl`) and funds it from the `whale` account.

For a list of available accounts see [accounts.json](https://github.com/Four4Two/futool/blob/master/config/common/addresses.json), or the [keyring directory](https://github.com/Four4Two/futool/tree/master/config/templates/fury/master/initstate/.fury/keyring-test).

Additionally, you can just exec into a shell in the container. Futool manages everything with docker-compose and it exposes a command that will run docker-compose in the required location. The running configuration is in `futool/full_configs/docker-compose.yaml`.

```
$ futool testnet dc -- exec furynode bash

### Config Templates

Config templates control the initial genesis file used to start the network and contain the . They also include all the account keys for accounts configured in the docker container.

The available config templates can be found in [`config/templates/fury/`](https://github.com/Four4Two/futool/tree/master/config/templates/fury).

By default, `futool` runs with the `master` config template which defaults to the `master` docker tag which is autodeployed whenever a commit is made to the master branch of `fury`. Occasionally, the configuration may become out of sync with what is currently on the master branch of fury. In these cases, it can be useful to use a template that uses a fixed docker tag with a working configuration:

For example, running a network with v0.4.1 of `fury`:

```
$ futool testnet bootstrap --fury.configTemplate v0.4.1
```

This won't be subject to changes breaking changes of `fury` that have yet to be updated in `futool`'s master template.

### Docker Image Tag

Additionally, all fury confiug templates support overriding the docker image tag. A full list of available tags is available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/fury/fury/tags).

You can override the tag by setting the `FURY_TAG` environment variable. For instance running the master template with a fixed fury version of `v0.4.1`:

```
FURY_TAG=v0.4.1 futool testnet bootstrap
```

Note that at the time you're reading this, the master template's genesis and configuration may not be compatible with fury version v0.4.1.

This is also useful for the development of `fury` itself. You can build a docker image, give it a tag like `fury/fury:TAG_HERE`, and then run a local network with the built image. There is a shortcut for this in the `fury` repo.

```bash
cd fury
# the docker-build command builds the docker image and tags it `fury/fury:local`
make docker-build
# then you can run a network with the image you created
FURY_TAG=local futool testnet bootstrap
```

## But wait! There's more!

`futool` has a lot more functionality than simply running a single local Blackfury Network. Be sure to use its `--help` command and check out the repo's [README.md](https://github.com/Four4Two/futool/blob/master/README.md).

It supports things like running two networks with an open IBC channel, chain upgrades, and more.

Be sure to check out our guide on [developing for Blackfury's EVM](../ethereum/development).

**Disclaimer**: `futool` is beta software. ðŸ˜Š Some of its features may not always work as expected. Generally, the commands used in this guide are frequently used enough to be reliable.

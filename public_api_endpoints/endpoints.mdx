Highbury provides public API endpoints for the community to use for consuming and integrating with Highbury, e.g. for setting up and syncing a new archive node or getting the latest block info.

## Pruning API

Pruning APIs provide information on the last 1000 blocks, and are useful for getting the latest state and most recent transactions.

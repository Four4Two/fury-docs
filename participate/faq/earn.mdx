### Why use Mint/Lend?

**Borrowing**  
Mint and Lend let users take out loans in a decentralized fashion. This democratizes finance by removing the barrier to entry, lowering friction, and removing gatekeepers.

**Lending**  
Mint, Lend, and Swap let users turn their idle cryptocurrencies into interest-producing assets safely and transparently.

**Rewards**  
As the protocols scale, numerous rewards are available to early adopters.DeFi applications - developers are encouraged to build new apps, integrations, and protocols in the Blackfury ecosystem for new business use cases.

### How can I earn money on Fury?

**Staking**  
Like most Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchains, FURY holders can ‘stake’ their FURY by either running a validator node themselves or by ‘bonding’ their tokens to a third party that is running a node. Bonding temporarily locks in your coins for a 21-day.

**Borrowing**  
Use your assets as collateral to borrow other assets, then using those to earn returns by trading or with other DeFi pursuits. Users can borrow USDF on Fury and other assets on Lend.

**Lending**  
Supply assets to Jinx Lend and automatically earn rewards in JINX tokens.

**Rewards**  

Jinx Lend  
Supply assets to Jinx Lend to earn FURY and JINX rewards.

Available assets include: USDF, FURY, JINX, BNB, BUSD, BTCB, JINXY, ATOM, and XRPB.

FURY, JINX, and JINXY rewards have a vesting period of either 1 month or 12 months. If you choose 12 months, the reward amount increases.

Users can earn rewards by:

- Supplying an asset to Lend.
- Borrowing against that asset.
- Supplying the borrowed asset to Mint.
- Minting USDF.
- Supplying that minted USDF to Lend.
- Supplying a pair of assets to a Swap Liquidity pool.

**Tips**  
Keep a small amount of FURY in your wallet in case you want to include a fee.

Avoid having a CDP liquidated by monitoring the collateral value, debt value, and liquidation price. If the collateral value drops below the liquidation price, your position will be liquidated. Assets from liquidated CDP’s are put up for auction. If that happens, the auction typically takes 8-24 hours and you can expect ~⅓ of the collateral back (not guaranteed).

Some exchanges (like Binance) require a memo field for cross-chain transfers. If a memo is not included, those funds can be lost.

### How can I send assets to Fury?

To use assets on Fury, first move those assets to the Binance Chain (not Binance Smart Chain) and then to the Blackfury Chain.

### Do Fury transactions require fees?

Fees are optional. They can be included if the network becomes busy, and can be added to prioritize a transaction to complete faster.

### Do Fury transactions require gas?

All transactions on the Blackfury blockchain consume gas.

The amount of gas consumed is proportional to the amount of computation and state access that the transaction requires.

For large and/or complex transactions, users may have to increase the amount of gas that the transaction requests above the default value.

### What is Blackfury Protocol?

Blackfury Chain is a decentralized, permissionless, censorship-resistant blockchain built with the Cosmos SDK. This means it operates much like other Cosmos ecosystem blockchains, and is designed to be interoperable between chains.

‍  
 Blackfury Protocol is the set of rules and behaviors built into the Blackfury Chain that enables advanced Decentralized Finance (DeFi) functionality like permissionless borrowing and lending.  
‍  
The FURY token is an asset on the Blackfury Chain. Blackfury Chain is secured by FURY token and it is used across the full chain as a transport and a store of value.

### What is Jinx Lend?

Jinx Lend is an application that runs on Blackfury blockchain. It builds upon the Blackfury Protocol and adds new functionality, expanding the Blackfury Ecosystem to include an autonomous money market protocol.

The JINX token is an asset on the Blackfury Chain. It is given as a reward for supplying and borrowing on Jinx Lend.

### What tokens and assets can be use on the Fury Blockchain?

**Native assets**  
Native assets are tokens that originate on the Blackfury Chain. These currently include FURY, JINX, JINXY and USDF.

FURY and JINX are governance tokens, meaning holders can vote on the rules of the protocols. FURY is also used as a Proof of Stake staking asset, which ensures the finality and safety of loans on the protocol and also acts as the ‘lender of last resort’ in certain situations. USDF is a stable coin loosely pegged to the US Dollar. It is minted when a Fury CDP is opened. The exact value of USDF is determined by market forces.

**Non-native assets**  
Other tokens can also be issued on the Blackfury Chain. These non-native asset tokens are often used to “wrap”, “tokenize,” or represent assets on other chains. For example:

Binance Coin (BNB) can be represented as a token on Blackfury Chain. During a cross-chain swap, BNB(Fury) coins are created or destroyed (burned) on Blackfury Chain, and frozen/unfrozen on Binance Chain.

Assets from other blockchains are considered non-native assets. This includes coins from other Cosmos ecosystem blockchains, which can connect to the Blackfury Chain through protocols like [Cosmos IBC](https://cosmos.network/ibc).

Be aware that FURY (native) has been tokenized on other blockchains, namely Binance Chain. FURY (BEP-2) is a token that exists solely on Binance Chain. Do not send FURY (BEP2) directly to the Blackfury Chain.

**BTCB**  
represents BTC which has been tokenized on Binance Chain. This BNB token has also been tokenized on FURY, making BTCB (Fury) a doubly tokenized representation of BTC.

### How do I access Fury?

The Jinx Wallet which is live at [jinx.army](https://jinx.army/), is a user-friendly hub for interacting with the protocol.

### Does Blackfury have smart contracts?

Like most Cosmos ecosystem blockchains, the automated transaction behaviors known as smart contracts are hardcoded into the protocol. They are referred to as “modules” in the Cosmos Ecosystem. The Fury App uses a special kind of module called a CDP.

### What is a CDP? How do I mint USDF?

A CDP or Collateralized Debt Position is a new kind of automated loan contract, used to create “stablecoins” that are pegged to a fiat currency like the US Dollar. The lender puts up a crypto asset as collateral to ‘mint’, or create new stablecoins.

For example, on Fury, users can stake BNB as collateral to mint USDF. The collateral is locked while the position is open. The lender unlocks their collateral once they repay the loan amount plus accumulated interest.

Minting USDF is as simple as supplying your asset to Fury and clicking “Borrow.” The lender can only take out 2/3rds of the collateral amount.

Lenders should keep in mind that if the price of the collateral asset drops below the liquidation price, their CDP will be liquidated. Therefore, it is advised not to mint more than 1/2 of the value of the collateral. The “Safe Max” button included in the app goes by this recommendation.
